## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{id},@var{errorcode} =} ENgetpatternid(@var{index})
## Gets the text id of a (or some) patterns
## @var{index} is an integer which is the index of the pattern
## Outputs:
## @var{id} is a string with the pattern identifier, it should be a string variable containing the string and not the string itself. No idea of why it cause problem the later...
## It can be run vectorized where id would be a string cell array, in case index is an array
## @var{errorcode} can also be retrieved
## @seealso{ENgetpatternid, ENgetpatternvalue, ENsetpatternvalue}
## @end deftypefn
