## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{index},@var{errorcode} =} ENgetnodeindex(@var{nodeid})
## Runs a step of hydraulic simulation.
## @var{nodeid} is a string with the node identifier, it should be a string variable containing the string and not the string itself. No idea of why it cause problem the later...
## It can be run vectorized where nodeid would be a string cell array, whereas index and errorcode are returned as arrays nodeid ={"n1","n5"} --> index and errorcode would be 1x2 arrays
## Outputs:
## @var{index} is an integer which is the index of the node
## @var{errorcode} can also be retrieved
## @seealso{ENgetnodeid, ENgetnodevalue, ENsetnodevalue}
## @end deftypefn

function [index,errorcode] = ENgetnodeindex(nodeid)
  if  ~iscell(nodeid),
    [index,errorcode] = ocENgetnodeindex(nodeid);
  else
    [index,errorcode] = cellfun ("ocENgetnodeindex",nodeid);
  endif
