## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{index} =} ENlinkid2index(@var{cellids}, @var{id})
## Get the ids of all the links parting from a cellarray of sortered index (obtained previously with ENgetlinkid([]), e.g. allLinks = ENgetlinkid([]); ENlinkid2index(allLinks,identificacionnodo). It also works with nodes, however a new function is suggested for nodes just
## for making code easier to read. It returns 0 when a id is not found.
## It can run with EPANET Toolkit closed
## @var{index} is an integer which is the index of the link
## Outputs:
## @var{id} is a string with the link identifier, it should be a string variable containing the string and not the string itself. No idea of why it cause problem the later...
## It can be run vectorized where id would be a string cell array, in case index is an array
## @seealso{ENgetlinkid, ENgetlinkvalue, ENsetlinkvalue}
## @end deftypefn

#not found, 0 chosen instead of -999 to be coherent with other TK functions
