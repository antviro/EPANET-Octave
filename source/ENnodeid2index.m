## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{index} =} ENnodeid2index(@var{cellids}, @var{id})
## Get the ids of all the nodes parting from a cellarray of sortered index (obtained previously with ENgetnodeid([]), e.g. allNodes = ENgetnodeid([]); ENnodeid2index(allNodes,identificacionnodo).
## It also works with links (actually, it is just a copy of it replacing "link" with "node")
## for making code easier to read. It returns 0 when a id is not found.
## It can run with EPANET Toolkit closed
## @var{index} is an integer which is the index of the node
## Outputs:
## @var{id} is a string with the node identifier, it should be a string variable containing the string and not the string itself. No idea of why it cause problem the later...
## It can be run vectorized where id would be a string cell array, in case index is an array
## @seealso{ENgetnodeid, ENgetnodevalue, ENsetnodevalue}
## @end deftypefn
