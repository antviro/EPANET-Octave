## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{index},@var{errorcode} =} ENgetpatternindex(@var{patternid})
## Runs a step of hydraulic simulation.
## @var{patternid} is a string with the pattern identifier, it should be a string variable containing the string and not the string itself. No idea of why it cause problem the later...
## It can be run vectorized where patternid would be a string cell array, whereas index and errorcode are returned as arrays patternid =@{"n1","n5"@} --> index and errorcode would be 1x2 arrays
## Outputs:
## @var{index} is an integer which is the index of the pattern
## @var{errorcode} can also be retrieved
## @seealso{ENgetpatternid, ENgetpatternvalue, ENsetpatternvalue}
## @end deftypefn

    [index,errorcode] = ocENgetpatternindex(patternid);
