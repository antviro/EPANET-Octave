## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{errorcode}] =} ENsetpatternvalue(@var{id},@var{period},@var{factor})
## Sets the multiplier factors of period  nt for a specific time pattern
## Outputs:
## @var{errorcode} can also be retrieved
## Inputs:
## @var{id} is the integer index of the pattern (it works vectorised aswell).
## @var{period} period within time pattern
## @var{factor} is the factor we want to set up
