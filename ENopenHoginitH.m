## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{errorcode} =} ENopenHoginitH(@var{flag})
## Opens the hydraulic analysis system and initializates it. It must be run before ENrunH, ENnextH.
## Initializes the simulation (tank levels, link status, clock time, ...).@.@*
## @var{flag} is an integer which can be 0, 1, 10 or 11 (selfnote: check  that is not binary formatted 0,1,2,3)@.@*
## 0 do not re-initialize flows, do not save results to file@.@*
## 1 do not re-initialize flows, save results to file@.@*
## 10 re-initialize flows, do not save results to file (default)@.@*
## 11 re-initialize flows, save results to file@.@*
## It returns two error codes, one for the opening of the hydraulic system and another one for the initialization,
## if the openning fails it does not go on with the initialization returning an empty array as second error code@.@*
