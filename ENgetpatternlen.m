## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{len},@var{errorcode}] =} ENgetpatternlen(@var{id})
## Gets the number of time periods in a specific time pattern.
## It can be run vectorized where nodeid would be a string cell array, whereas index and errorcode are returned as arrays nodeid ={"n1","n5"} --> index and errorcode would be 1x2 arrays
## Outputs:
## @var{len} is the length we wanteed to obtain
## @var{errorcode} can also be retrieved
## Inputs:
## @var{id} is the integer index of the pattern (can be a vector/matrix). If no node is specified all nodes length are retrieved e.g. ENgetpatternlen ([],10)
## @seealso{ENgetnodeid, ENgetpatternlen, ENsetpatternlen}
## @end deftypefn

    [len,errorcode] = ocENgetpatternlen(id);

  else   # all nodes retrieved
    id =1:ENgetcount(3);
    [len,errorcode] = arrayfun ("ocENgetpatternlen",id);
